# Fresh Air Finder

## Description
We first structured the website and styling with the CSS framework ***Bulma***.  Utilizing the National Park Service API and OpenWeather API we built an application that will display National Parks with a 5-Day Forecast to match for each park.  Upon selecting a state from the drop down, you will be shown a list of the parks coordinating with that state.  Next to the park, there is a button to display the weather in a modal.  Below said list will be an image from the park, a description of the park, and some contact info for that park with a link to the parks website. Each state you select will be saved to local storage and shown as a button that will take you to that list of parks for that state.

## Acceptance Criteria
```
Application uses at least two server-side APIs.

Application uses client-side storage to store persistent data.

Application doesn't use JS alerts, prompts, or confirms (uses modals instead).

Application uses a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.

Application is interactive (accepts and responds to user input)
